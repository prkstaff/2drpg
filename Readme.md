I DO NOT recommend copying and pasting from tutorials to make your game. 
You arenâ€™t learning anything that way, you are just copying. 
That goes double for open source programs. They are fine to look at, study, and reference, 
but they are not a means of making the game for you. You will not become a good and effective 
programmer by copying and pasting source code into your game unless you fully understand it. Do not cheat yourself this way, 
take the extra time and understand something before you use it.
